# Heavy_Blocks
HS Tech Intern Course (2D GUI Game). Approximate timeline: half a semester. My first major application built in java on processing. The player navigates through various levels at which Heavy Blocks fall from the sky, creating paths, obstacles and potential for death. 
To run this program you need processing 3.5.4.
After unzipping the folder you will find several processing files, in order to open the project you will have to ensure the folder has the name of any of these processing files.
